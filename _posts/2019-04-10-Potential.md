## Project Details
- 3D First-Person Shooter
- 10 weeks half-time
- Made with our own C++ DirectX11 engine

## Contributions
- **Screen Space Reflections** [read more](/SSR/)
- **Volumetric Lighting** - [read mode](#)
- **Area Lights**
- **More Powerful Particle System** - I remade our particle system as our artists felt they wanted a bit more control with their effects compared to the old particle system.
- **Game feel** - I worked quite a bit with game feel, things such as the gun's emissive increasing when you shoot and healthbars having nice easings etc.
