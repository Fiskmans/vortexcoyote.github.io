## Project Details
- 2D Top down adventure game
- 8 weeks half-time
- Made with an our house 2D C++ engine

## Contributions
- **Player** - I wrote the player, which incorporated many animations and combo's that were hard to get right in a 2D isometric game.
- **Camera** - I kept the camera and frustum culling from last project, but tweaked it to work isometrically.
- **Pickups** - I implemented the different pickups in the game, health and money drops.
- **Particle System** - I used and improved upon my particle system from last [project](/ScoutMountain/)
